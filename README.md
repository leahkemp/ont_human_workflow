Here we are implementing a generic workflow for processing ONT sequencing data based on the work Miles Benton and the Singapore - New Zealand Applications Project Support Team, Oxford Nanopore Technologies put together. This involves adapting scripts to run on ESR's production network, including deploying to slurm. See the original work in the [./workflow_outline/](./workflow_outline/) directory.
